OverlayFS Linux kernel patches
==============================

Note, I am NOT a developer for the OverlayFS at all. But I desire to use
OverlayFS and required kernel patches to apply to my kernel sources.

The official OverlayFS sources are at
http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/mszeredi/vfs.git/

I was unable to find any patches to apply OverlayFS to an existing kernel
source tree. It appears that OverlayFS is developed as branches in a git
repo of the entire Linux kernel source tree. I extracted patches for each
of the OverlayFS versions as per this procedure.

Linux 3.9-rc2    overlayfs.v16
Linux 3.6-rc4    overlayfs.v15
Linux 3.6-rc1    overlayfs.v14

I was unable to create patches for overlayfs.v11 and overlayfs.v12.
